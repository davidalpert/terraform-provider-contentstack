## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) An API Key which uniquely identifies the stack which this provider will configure.
- `debug` (Boolean) enable debug logs for the ContentStack API client
- `host` (String) Base URL
- US (North America, or NA): https://api.contentstack.io/
- Europe (EU): https://eu-api.contentstack.com/
- Azure NA: https://azure-na-api.contentstack.com/
- `management_token` (String, Sensitive) Management Tokens are stack-level tokens, with no users attached to them. They can do everything that authtokens can do. Since they are not personal tokens, no role-specific permissions are applicable to them. It is recommended to use these tokens for automation scripts, third-party app integrations, and for Single Sign On (SSO)-enabled organizations.
